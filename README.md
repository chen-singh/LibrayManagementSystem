# LibrayManagementSystem
 Project Showcase: Console-Based Library Book Management System using Java (OOP + ArrayList)  📚 I'm excited to share a simple yet powerful Book Management System that I built using Core Java with full implementation of Object-Oriented Programming principles. This terminal-based application is ideal for managing a small library or book catalog.  
## 🔹 Features Implemented:

Add a new book (ID, Title, Author)

Search books by Title or Author

Update book details

Delete books by ID

Display all books in the system

## 🧰 Technologies Used:

Java (Core)

OOP (Encapsulation, Classes, Objects)

ArrayList for data storage (no database)

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code).
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.

### Alternatively, via Command Line:
